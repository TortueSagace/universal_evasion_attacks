# [Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandrelemercier/data-from-the-universal-evasion-attacks-package)

My master's thesis presents four different datasets used for the empirical tests:
- **MNIST** (directly available in TensorFlow)
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection** ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud))
- **CICIoT23** (from the Canadian Institude of Cybersecurity, preprocessed by me to focus on interesting targets)
- **N-BaIoT** (from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkashifn/nbaiot-dataset), preprocessed by me to focus on interesting targets)

The two last datasets are available in a shared database I created on Kaggle, so that anyone can access them easily. Please not that the CIC version of Kaggle does not correspond to the original dataset. The link to the database is in the title of this card.
