Chapter 2 of my master's thesis presents empirical tests over several classifiers to determine which ones to choose for conducting evasion attacks. In this chapter, some popular image classifiers were briefly mentionned, including XCeption, but no concrete example is provided. As I already worked with this model before, I decided to share the notebook I made about it on Kaggle (brain tumor MRI classification). The link is in the title of this card.
