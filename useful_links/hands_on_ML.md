# [Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/)

I am very grateful to Aurélien Géron for writing this book. It is a very good introduction to machine learning, and I learned a lot from it. I cited Aurélien Géron several times in my master's thesis. The book is available on the O'Reilly website, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about machine learning. The link can be found to title of this card.
