Autoencoders are a type of neural network that learns to copy its input to its output. They work by compressing the input into a latent-space representation, and then reconstructing the output from this representation. The autoencoder architechture was first studied as an interesting candidate for zero-day attacks detection in the field of cybersecurity (corresponding to the CIC dataset), but I then choose to replace it by the tree-based models XGBoost, LightGBM, HistGradientBoosting and ExtraTrees. As I nevertheless made a significant amount of research on autoencoders, I decided to link here the notebook I made about it on Kaggle. The chapter corresponding to autoencoders was removed from the final version of my master's thesis.
